# NZ Medicinal Cannabis Agency license history
Historical list of licenses granted by the agency to make it easy to view changes over time, sourced from their [website list](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/medicinal-cannabis-agency/medicinal-cannabis-agency-information-industry/medicinal-cannabis-agency-current-licence-holders).

The easiest way to view this from a browser is to tap on licenses.txt, then view the history of the file.

You can also compare across time using something such as:

https://github.com/Chill-Division/mca-licenses/compare/dbaaa66..9eda61b

Using the SHA hash from the oldest commit first, followed by two dots, and then the SHA hash for the new commit

Also, when viewing licenses.txt you'll see a list of rows, allowing for an easy count of how many license holders there are at any given stage (Minus the ~2-3 unlisted ones that have opted not to be shown on the MCA website)
